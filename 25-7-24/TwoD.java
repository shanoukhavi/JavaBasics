    //multidimenesional aray is 2 d arry now hu want to do it  in the row or the collums wat stu0 is first one stu2 is the frisst sedcond mate and evrything is much been possible to do it mate so nt been doing it before these have started it 

    //how wt o declare int mate row and collumn u gige it mate 
    //it i s array fo aaray mat e

    //iske andar size uska 2 hai bhaijei  here it iwill show u then zero bhaiji
    //its shas the elelemtns mate 
    //the elelemtns are been zeor
}    //conevr titt into the rarr isneide the earr this can be done to do it as sbeen seen to do it  eevything is ben achievabeele it amte as 00 and -1 and 02  1 zero 1 1 1 2 3 1 3 i2 an d 3 2 mate everythin is been mate but u simplifyit as per ur requiremenet
